# Information about the input file:
#   If the input dataset has the URL
#     https://search.kg.ebrains.eu/instances/<some_hexadecimal_string>
#   then `input_dataset` should be set to "<some_hexadecimal_string>"
#   and `input_file` to the relative path of the file within the dataset
#   The file needs to be in a file that can be read by Neo,
#   and `input_format` should be set to the name of the Neo IO module.
#   (see https://neo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/iolist.html)
